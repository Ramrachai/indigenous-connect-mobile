# Indigenous Connect MOBILE APP

## Overview

**Indigenous Connect** is a web application designed to foster unity and connectivity among the indigenous people of Bangladesh, including communities such as Marma, Chakma, Khasia, Garo, Manipuri, Tripura, and others. Our goal is to provide a platform where members of these communities can connect, share, and collaborate to strengthen their cultural identity and promote inclusivity.

# Note
This project might not have the most cutting-edge code you'll find online, but it works! My goal here isn’t to create something revolutionary or to write the most efficient, scalable, or high-quality code ever. Instead, the main focus is to encourage members of the indigenous community to contribute—even if it’s just a single line of code.

I’m keeping things simple and accessible. You won’t find overly complex tech stacks, advanced coding techniques, or intricate abstractions here. I avoid creating too much reusable code or forcing people to dig through endless folders just to make a simple service. I try to keep all related code in one file or close by. The idea is to make it easy for anyone with basic coding skills to jump in and contribute.

Oh, and feel free to use AI tools for coding assistance! The goal is to create something together, no matter how big or small your contribution may be.
